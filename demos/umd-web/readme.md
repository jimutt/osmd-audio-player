# OSMD Audio Player - Basic demo (UMD build)

Basic demo with a single score and only play, pause and stop functionality. The primary difference from the "basic" demo is that this uses the UMD build of OSMD Audio Player and OSMD. Which means that it does not rely on Node.js and intermediate build steps.
