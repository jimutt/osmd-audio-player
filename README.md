# ðŸŽµ OSMD Audio player

Unoffical audio playback engine for [OpenSheetMusicDisplay](https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay). Successor meant to replace my previous proof of concept player & demo at https://github.com/jimutt/osmd-playback-demo.

This player is still in a very early state and lots of breaking and non-breaking changes will most likely be introduced before the first major release. Use at your own risk!

## Install

```
npm install osmd-audio-player
```

## Demos

### Basic

Basic no-framework demo with only play, pause & stop functionality.

**Live demo:** https://osmd-audio-player-demo-basic.netlify.com/ <br/>
**Source:** https://github.com/jimutt/osmd-audio-player/tree/master/demos/basic

### Vue JS + Vuetify

A more full-featured demo featuring configurable instruments, level control, switching scores & changing tempo.

You might notice that there's currently a quite large delay when switching instruments. It's due to the in-advance scheduling to prevent interruptions & timing issues in the audio playback, and there's currently no clearing/reset of the buffer when an instrument change takes place. Some improvements in that area are planned.

## Features
